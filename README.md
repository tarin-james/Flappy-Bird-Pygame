# Overview

This is a project where I created a flappy bird style game. You play just as you would the normal game, jumping through the pipes.

I wrote this to learn more about pygame and how to use it.

# Development Environment

To develop this program, i used pygame and pygame mixer. I was able to learn how to add sound effects using pygame mixer. Learning pygame wasn't too steep of a learning code since it is still using python, but it was definitely difficult figuring out all the quirks.

Luckily, i was able to find a file of the flappy bird .pngs used in the real game, so I was able to give the game an 'authentic' flappy bird experience. I also found the same sound effects used, although I could only find the flap and score sound.
